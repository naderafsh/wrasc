Watch-React Supervisory Control

Testing the idea of utilising declarative/functional programming for Supervisory Control of experimental and reserarch dircete systems.
At its core, there are Watch-React agents and the Watch-React system cycle. Aim is to put all non-side effect functions in Watch cycle
and limit and trace side effects of the React cycle by deriving the sequence from actual after-the-fact dependencies, as well as limiting
possible actions with templates.
